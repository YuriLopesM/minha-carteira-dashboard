## 📢 Description

**“Minha Carteira” (My Wallet)** is an application to organize your bills, using dashboards to view information and pages for cash inflows and outflows.

✨ This is just a Front-end app, using JSON files to reproduce the data. In the future, I want to implement this app with a Back-end and Database.
